# Group-1-CSC-394-Final-Project

This project aimed to create a website that allows you to create an account and through this account you can have multiple different movie tier lists with hundreds of movies from the TMDB database. Here we leveraged Django/Python, HTML/CSS, Postgres/PGAdmin4, Nginx and Docker to bring this project to life.
